												<br><b>Sarah Filippi</b> (Imperial College London)
												<br><a class="collapsible" href="javascript:void(0)">[show abstract]</a>
													<div class="content">
														Many machine learning models require fixing their capacity before training, such as the number of neurons in a neural network or inducing points in a Gaussian process. Increasing capacity typically improves performance until the available information in the data is captured, after which computational costs continue to grow without benefit. This raises the question: how big is big enough? In this talk, I address this problem for Gaussian processes in continual learning, where data arrives incrementally and the final dataset size is unknown in advance. In this setting, standard heuristics for choosing a fixed model size are unavailable. I present a method that automatically adapts model capacity online, achieving near-optimal predictive performance while avoiding unnecessary computation. All hyperparameters are set without access to dataset properties, and experiments across diverse datasets show that the method performs robustly with substantially less tuning than existing approaches. I will also briefly discuss related issues in scaling Gaussian processes with stochastic optimization, showing how minibatch-induced gradient noise can slow convergence in sparse variational models, and outlining a variance-reduction approach that accelerates training without full-batch computations.

												<br><b>Dennis Prangle</b> (University of Bristol)
												<br><a class="collapsible" href="javascript:void(0)">[show abstract]</a>
													<div class="content">
														Neural posterior estimation enables approximate Bayesian inference using conditional density estimation from simulated prior-data pairs, typically reducing the data to low-dimensional summary statistics. NPE is susceptible to misspecification when observations deviate from the training distribution. We introduce minimum-distance summaries, a plug-in robust NPE method that adapts queried test-time summaries independently of the pretrained NPE. Leveraging the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a distance between observed data and a summary-conditional predictive distribution, the adapted summary inherits strong robustness properties from the MMD. We demonstrate that the algorithm can be implemented efficiently with random Fourier feature approximations, yielding a lightweight, model-free test-time adaptation procedure. We provide theoretical guarantees for the robustness and consistency of our algorithm and empirically evaluate it on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating substantial robustness gains with minimal additional overhead.

												<br><b>Arina Odnoblyudova</b> (University College London)
												<br><a class="collapsible" href="javascript:void(0)">[show abstract]</a>
													<div class="content">
														Bayesian inference should ideally not be overly sensitive to the choice of prior or hyperparameters, but even defining and measuring this sensitivity is challenging.  Existing global sensitivity measures typically involve significant trade-offs between strength of the measure, interpretability, and computational tractability. Unfortunately, most methods are unable to serve the needs of modern Bayesian inference due to their high computational cost and poor performance in multiple dimensions. To address these limitations, we introduce a new approach to global sensitivity analysis which only requires a set of samples from a reference posterior and the ability to evaluate score functions, making it broadly computationally tractable. We demonstrate our proposed method on challenging Bayesian inference problems which are practically out of reach of existing approaches, including Bayesian inference for heavy-tailed time series, simulation-based inference for problems in telecommunications engineering, and generalised Bayesian inference for doubly-intractable models.

												<br><b>Mathieu Gerber</b> (University of Bristol)
												<br><a class="collapsible" href="javascript:void(0)">[show abstract]</a>
													<div class="content">
														We investigate the convergence properties of a class of iterative algorithms designed to minimize a potentially non-smooth and noisy objective function, which may be algebraically intractable andwhose values may be obtained as the output of a black box. The algorithms considered can be cast under the umbrella of a generalised gradient descent recursion, where the gradient is that of a smooth approximation of the objective function. The framework we develop includes as special cases model-based and mollification methods, two classical approaches to zero-th order optimisation. The convergence results are obtained under very weak assumptions on the regularity of the objective function and involve a trade-off between the degree of smoothing and size of the steps taken in the parameter updates. As expected, additional assumptions are required in the stochastic case. We illustrate the relevance of these algorithms and our convergence results through a challenging classification example from machine learning.

												<br><b>Heishiro Kanagawa</b> (Fujitsu Research)
												<br><a class="collapsible" href="javascript:void(0)">[show abstract]</a>
													<div class="content">
														Several emerging post-Bayesian methods target a probability distribution for which an entropy-regularised variational objective is minimised. This increased flexibility introduces a computational challenge, as one loses access to an explicit unnormalised density for the target. To mitigate this difficulty, we introduce a novel measure of suboptimality called gradient discrepancy, and in particular a kernel gradient discrepancy (KGD) that can be explicitly computed. In the standard Bayesian context, KGD coincides with the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), and we obtain a novel characterisation of KSD as measuring the size of a variational gradient. Outside this familiar setting, KGD enables novel sampling algorithms to be developed and compared, even when unnormalised densities cannot be obtained.

												<br><b>Arnaud Doucet</b> (University of Oxford)
												<br><a class="collapsible" href="javascript:void(0)">[show abstract]</a>
													<div class="content">
														We present self-speculative masked diffusions, a new class of masked diffusion generative models for discrete data that require significantly fewer function evaluations to generate samples. Standard masked diffusion models predict factorized logits over currently masked positions. A number of masked positions are then sampled; however, the factorization approximation means that sampling too many positions in one go leads to poor sample quality. As a result, many simulation steps and therefore neural network function evaluations are required to generate high-quality data. We reduce the computational burden by generating non-factorized predictions over masked positions. This is achieved by modifying the final transformer attention mask from non-causal to causal, enabling draft token generation and parallel validation via a novel, model-integrated speculative sampling mechanism. This results in a non-factorized predictive distribution over masked positions in a single forward pass. We find that we can achieve a ~2x reduction in the required number of network forward passes relative to standard masked diffusion models.

														Deep generative models are transforming how we solve some of science's hardest puzzles: inverse problems where we must work backwards from noisy, incomplete observations to uncover hidden physical states. In this talk, we will explore three scales of application, from characterizing the atmospheres of distant exoplanets light years away, to reconstructing turbulent fluid dynamics from sparse measurements, to assimilating satellite data across the entire Earth's atmosphere in real time. We will see how normalizing flows, score based diffusion models, and latent space compression allow us to tackle problems spanning tens to billions of variables, revealing not just single solutions but entire distributions of physically plausible states.
